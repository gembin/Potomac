	 * A PageInput is a lightweight argument passed to a Page.  For most pages, the 
	 * input is typically null, but when multiple instances of a given page are required
	 * an input should be used.  Inputs differentiate the different instances.  For example,
	 * if a page works on an 'Employee' object, the input might contain the employee ID.  
	 * <p>
	 * Inputs should not contain full model elements.  Instead they should maintain as little
	 * information as possible to allow the model to be retrieved.  This typically means the input
	 * should contain primary key information only.  Inputs will be serialized and stored between
	 * application sessions.  They will be deserialized and recreated in order to the user to shown
	 * the same pages that were shown during his last application session.</p>
	 * <p>
	 * PageInput is a dynamic object.  Developers are encouraged to write their own subclasses of 
	 * PageInput but it isn't required.  Dynamic properties can be attached to a PageInput.  Integer and String
	 * dynamic properties will be automatically serialized and checked during #equals.  Subclasses must 
	 * re-implement #equals().
	 * </p>
